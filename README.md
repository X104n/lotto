# Lotto application

This is a simple application which utilizes the Norsk Tipping API to fetch the combined results of lotto games between two dates.
I have only implemented the normal lotto game and nothing more, even though the API supports more games.

## The API
I found this API in December 2022, and then I could get all the data from one date to another without any problems.
However, when I went back in the summer of 2023 to work more on this project the API was restricted to fetching a maximum of 15 weeks at a time.
I find this a bit funny, and would like to believe that I was the reason for this restriction. For instance I tried pulling all numbers between 01.01.2000 and to the current date at which I worked on the project.
This operation took at least 1 min to complete, and show up in the website.

Feel free to use the API yourself. I will try to implement a better version for this application at [badeklubben.no](https://badeklubben.no).

## The project now

As the time of writing I will be experimenting with docker and some GitHub features at this project before archiving it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
